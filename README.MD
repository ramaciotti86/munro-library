Munro Library API
===========================================

The goal of this solution is to create a simple API which other software can use to sort and filter the munro data.

What did I use in this project
--------------------------
* Spring
* Lombok
  * turn dev life easier :)
  * lombok.config at root folder
* Junit
  * Just a few tests but I could right tests to controller and service  
* HTTP Requests
  * find requests under "test/httpRequests"

Findings
--------------------------
<p>I found very interesting to create this app as I could develop more in java using some functionalities that we can use in everyday work.</p>
<p>The project and the challenge to develop using functional approach and using CSV as "DB" makes you think in how could we approach the solution in different ways.</p>
<p>Any questions, please, dont hesitate to ask. :) </p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity and hope to hear from you soon.</p>
